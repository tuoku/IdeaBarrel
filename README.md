## Features
  - #### Suggest improvements
    Have an idea to make your workplace better? IdeaBarrel is the most effortless way to make your voice heard!
    
  - #### Vote your coworkers ideas into reality
    Featuring a familiar and intuitive voting system, simply swipe right on any ideas you'd like to see come true!
    
  - #### Brainstorm a better workplace
    If you're feeling particulary inspired by an idea you can share your thoughts in the comments, or just commend the submitter!
    
  - #### Inspire engagement
    Fun leaderboards and gamifications make sure the collective thoughts of the workplace don't go unheard.
    
  - #### Earn rewards
    You earn 1 point every time you vote on an idea (like or dislike) and 10 points every time an idea you submitted gets liked! These points can be used       to redeem various rewards.
    
  - #### Streamlined process for busy departments
    Ideas are categorized by departments responsible for their implementation, and every week the heads of departments (or any designated persons) get a       summary email of past weeks top ideas with a simple interface for approving them.
    
  - #### Simple authentication
     This version of the app uses a simple per-installation authentication meaning you "log-out" by uninstalling the app and once logged out you cannot        log in with the same user again.

## Notes for contributors
Most CI issues can be avoided by running `dart fix --apply` and `flutter format .` before pushing your commits to GitHub.
If you want to make sure it will pass, run:

`flutter format --set-exit-if-changed .`

`flutter analyze .`

`flutter test`

`flutter build apk`

If all four finish with no errors you're good to go!
